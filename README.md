# Sales Insights Data Analysis Project

## Problem Statement


At AtliQ Technologies, which operates several branches throughout India, the sales director is facing challenges understanding the company's current problems and performance. Sales figures are falling short of expectations.

When the director asks regional managers for updates on sales and market conditions, they often provide overly optimistic reports and flood the director with numerous Excel files. This adds to the director's frustration because interpreting numbers from Excel can be difficult for people.

In essence, the sales director is struggling to grasp the true state of affairs due to the managers' tendency to paint a rosier picture than reality and inundate with complex data.

## Solution

As a data analyst, a solution to the sales director’s challenges at AtliQ Technologies would involve implementing business intelligence (BI) dashboards. These dashboards would offer visual representations of key data, pulling information from various sources such as sales records, market trends, and reports from regional managers.

By using these dashboards, the sales director can quickly gain insights into the company's current performance and understand any issues affecting sales. Instead of sifting through numerous Excel files and potentially misleading reports from managers, the director can rely on clear visuals that highlight important metrics and trends.
